**My Diary**  
> This diary puts all my diary entries since I started school in 2022 until 20 March 2024 on this page. I am an ordinary Chinese university student living an ordinary university life, and I have always had the habit of keeping a diary when I was a kid, except that with several moves, the diary I used to write down did not stay. Then I went to high school, and the pressure of school was so great that I didn't write in my diary anymore. After college, I started to record my life, study, thoughts, things I saw and people I met.  
> I have known the benefits of journaling since childhood and, although I have not always maintained the habit, I have been writing on and off for over six years. Hello there! It's amazing how writing can help us leave something behind for the world after we pass away. Throughout our lives, there is very little we can leave behind, but with journaling, we can share our thoughts and experiences with others. I do not know what kind of person I will be in fifty years or what actions I will take to make the world a better place. Don't you think? However, I have thought of a way to contribute to this goal. Would you like to hear about it?   As we continue to rely more on data, it becomes increasingly crucial to ensure its preservation. Preserving my diary, which serves as a text carrier and contains valuable data, means safeguarding the precious moments of my life. If a data scientist aims to comprehend the mental journey of an individual from ages 18 to 23 during their college years, including their thoughts on college life and personal growth, my diary could prove to be a valuable resource.
