##Diary--21.1.2024:
>Mum's giving; my bad self;
>> I managed to keep track of my time effectively thanks to my diary-keeping habit.  

 

Although I did not keep a diary during the competition period, I made sure to start keeping one as soon as school resumed. 

I spent two days with my mother, hiking on the first day and going shopping in town on the second. Unfortunately, on the third day, she fell ill and had a fever that night.   It was tough to see her in that condition.During my winter holidays, I stayed at home for three weeks before heading to Nanjing for a competition in the fourth week. Upon returning, I dedicated myself to revising my work. Attending the competition was a regretful experience due to the high cost, but I am confident in my decision to invest in my passion. While the race did not meet my expectations, I am certain that my preference for the new and dislike of the old is valid. I hope to avoid encountering those two individuals again, but I am satisfied with my investment despite the unsatisfactory result. 

Although I have conflicting desires, I am confident in my decision to study abroad. Despite my father's disagreement, I am determined to pursue this opportunity. Our shared goal is to excel academically, gain practical skills, and enhance our personal growth. While I am slightly apprehensive about taking the GRE, I am eager to learn and improve.   Rest assured, if granted the opportunity, I will give it my all.Although I am currently feeling miserable, I know that studying should be my top priority. 

I understand that internalizing my negative emotions is not helpful. In fact, I believe that travelling can be a great way to make new friends and gain a better understanding of oneself. Meeting new people can broaden one's horizons and lead to new opportunities for friendship. I have a great character and many ideas, and I love travelling to Thailand and playing games with my friends. Without a goal, I feel anxious and unmotivated. 

While my father has suggested that I attend graduate school, I am hesitant because I lack a clear goal. However, I am confident that I will find my path and achieve success in my own way.
